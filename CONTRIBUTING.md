```

## Testing

### Test Organization

Tests follow the **Go community standard**: test files are placed alongside the code they test.

- Unit tests: `*_test.go` files in the same directory as the implementation
- Example: `cmd/mkissue/mkissue.go` has tests in `cmd/mkissue/mkissue_test.go`

This is the idiomatic Go approach and makes tests easy to find and maintain.

### Writing Tests

- Use **table-driven tests** for multiple test cases
- Test both success and error paths
- Include edge cases
- Aim for high coverage on business logic

Example table-driven test:

```go
func TestFunction(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        input   string
        want    string
        wantErr bool
    }{
        {"valid input", "test", "result", false},
        {"error case", "", "", true},
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            got, err := Function(tt.input)
            if (err != nil) != tt.wantErr {
                t.Errorf("error = %v, wantErr %v", err, tt.wantErr)
                return
            }
            if got != tt.want {
                t.Errorf("got %v, want %v", got, tt.want)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

## Building

### Local Development Build

```bash
make build
```

This creates the `utils` binary in the repository root.

### Multi-Platform Builds

```bash
make build-all
```

Builds for:

- Linux: amd64, arm64
- Darwin (macOS): amd64, arm64
- Windows: amd64, arm64

Binaries are placed in the `dist/` directory.

### Clean Build Artifacts

```bash
make clean
```

## Pre-commit Hooks

The repository uses pre-commit hooks to maintain code quality. When you commit, the following checks run automatically:

1. **Spell checking** (cspell)
2. **Markdown linting**
3. **Code formatting** (prettier, gofmt)
4. **Go vet** - Static analysis
5. **golangci-lint** - Comprehensive linting
6. **Go tests** - All unit tests
7. **Build verification** - Ensures code compiles

If any check fails, the commit is rejected. Fix the issues and try again.

## Coding Standards

### Go Programming

- **Follow Go idioms**: Use standard Go patterns and conventions
- **Format with gofmt**: Code must be formatted with `gofmt`
- **Use golangci-lint**: Address all linter warnings
- **Document exports**: All exported functions, types, and constants need documentation
- **Error handling**: Always check and wrap errors with context

### CLI Design

- **Named flags**: Use `--flag value` instead of positional arguments
- **Short and long forms**: Provide both (e.g., `-f` and `--file`)
- **Clear help text**: Every command and flag should have descriptive help
- **Cobra framework**: Use Cobra for all CLI commands

### Package Organization

- **`cmd/`**: CLI command definitions and implementations
- **`internal/`**: Internal packages (if needed, currently not used)
- **One purpose per package**: Keep packages focused and cohesive

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflows automatically:

- Run tests with race detector
- Check code formatting
- Run all linters
- Build binaries
- Verify pre-commit hooks pass

See `.github/workflows/` for workflow definitions.

## Issue File Format

The `mkissue` command uses a specific format defined in [`exercises/template.issue.md`](exercises/template.issue.md). This is the **contract** for issue files:

- YAML frontmatter with metadata (title, assignees, labels, etc.)
- Markdown body for issue content

When making changes to issue parsing, ensure compatibility with this format.

## Common Tasks

### Add a New Command

1. Create command file in `cmd/` (e.g., `cmd/newcommand.go`)
2. Create implementation package if needed (e.g., `cmd/newcommand/newcommand.go`)
3. Add tests alongside implementation
4. Register command in `cmd/root.go` init function
5. Update README.md with usage documentation
6. Run tests and linters

### Update Dependencies

```bash
# Update go.mod and go.sum
go get -u ./...
go mod tidy

# Verify everything still works
make test
make build
```

### Debug Build Issues

```bash
# Clean everything
make clean

# Rebuild from scratch
make build

# Run with verbose output
go build -v -o ./utils .
```

## Getting Help

- Check the [RAG files](.github/copilot-instructions.md) first
- Look at existing code for examples
- Review closed pull requests for similar changes
- Open an issue if you have questions

## Code Review Process

When you submit a pull request:

1. Automated checks must pass (CI/CD)
2. Code will be reviewed by maintainers
3. Address any feedback
4. Once approved, your PR will be merged
